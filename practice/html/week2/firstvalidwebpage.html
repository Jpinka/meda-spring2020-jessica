<p><strong>Mars</strong> is the forth <a href = "#"> planet</a> from the <a href = "#">sun</a> and the second-smallest planet in the <a href = "#">Solar System</a> after <a href = "#"> Mercury</a>. In English, Mars carries a name of the <a href = "#"> Roman god of war </a> and is often referred to as the <strong>Red Planet</strong>. <a href = "#"><sup>[15][16]</sup></a>The latter refers to the effect of the <a href = "#"> iron oxide</a> prevalent on Mars' surface, which gives it a <a href = "#"> reddish appearance</a> distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye.<sup>[17]</sup> Mars is a <a href = "#">terrestrial planet<a> with a thin <a href = "#"> atmosphere</a>, having surface features reminiscent both of the <a href = "#"> impact craters</a> of the <a href = "#"> Moon</a> and the valleys, deserts, and <a href = "#"> polar ice caps</a> of <a href = "#">Earth</a>.
