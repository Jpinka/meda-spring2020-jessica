<!--Simple hello greeting-->
    <p>
        New users start here.
    </p>

    <p>  
        Greetings everyone who is viewing my first ever web page! See that cute girl in the picture. Yeah, thats ME! Let me tell you a little bit about me...as a <em>PROGRAMMER.</em>
    </p>

    <p><!--wikipedia link-->
        Like most people I have a lot of hobbies. I typically enjoy a range of art related projects. Currently my most favoriate hobby has been <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development" target="_blank">Web Developing</a>, or making websites. I assume you enjoy it as well or is at least curious about it since you found my page! So, as you guessed it, this web page is about my current hobby, Web Development and how you can start on your own learning path as a newbie Web Developer.
    </p>

    <p><!--Why do I like my hobby-->
        Why is making websites so great? You ask? Well, if you think about it, it is a art form in itself. A very tedious work of art, which was surprisingly enjoy able. I get a sense of accomplishment when I've seen what I have created and displayed on the web. I enjoy knowing that web users are using something I contributed to the world and hopefully enjoy using it. I also hope that when you leave my web page, you will have learned something new.
    </p> 
    <p><!--My early background as a newbie-->
        I myself, am a beginner web developer. Meaning I have the slills to make a decent web page but I also have a lot of room for growth. Looking back, I remember how challanging it was just to get started without having any sense of direction. My goal for this web page is to help my fellow newbies with a starting point based on my experiences and gained knowledge along with links to free resources that I have used, personally. Afterall, free is always good...unless you're robbing a bank, then free may not be so good.
    </p>   
    <p>
        So, here is a quick overview, about me and my coding journey. 
        I wanted to code but I had no idea that I could do it and all the resources I knew about were only geared towards kids and young adults. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I was 30 at the time, so my chances of finding free resources were very slim...or so I thought.
    </p>
    <p>
        Anyway, I was encouraged from a friend of mine to teach myself and learn using free platforms. (Feel free to read that mine again). I was in disbelief, so much, to the fact that I kept loook up paid courses becasue I had been conditioned by California's education system to spend money, learn a skill and get a job. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Yes, I just threw California under the bus for taking out $45k loans for an educaiton I thought I needed to be successful.
    </p>

        Well, lets stick it to em! <em>Who's with me?!</em>
    </p>
    <p>    
        How? Learn Web Development and <strong>NOT</strong> pay for an expensive college tuition! Best part? You could eventually seek employment opportunities.
    </p>
    <!--External links to kahn Academy and Free Code Camp.-->
    <p> 
        Well, you live and you learn and you <strong>never</strong> stop learning. The lessons I took from using free platforms such as <a href="http://www.kahnacademy.com" target="_blank">Kahn Academy</a> and <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com" target="_blank"> Free Code Camp</a> (which I will get into later) really made learning fun and revealed my true potential. So, if you are interested in Web Development, I encourage you to read the rest of this article and bookmark my page for upcoming content.

    <section id="basics">
        <h2>Just Learn the Basics for Now</h2>
    </section>

    <p>
        So how do I code?! Which language should I learn first?! Where do I start?!
    <p>

<p><!--External link explaning different programming langs-->
    Well, we need to know the difference between a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language" target="_blank">programming language</a> and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_language" target="_blank">computer language</a>. A programming language uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm" target="_blank">algorithms</a> in order to communicate with the computer to preform a specific task. A computer language, like HTML, communicates with the computer directly. AT least, that is the jist of it. There are two links above for more information surrounding the topic. Let's clear up a common misconception, there is no right or wrong language to learn first. However, I do recommended starting with <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/h/html.htm" target="_blank">HTML</a>, a computer markup language <!--markup language, techterms.com--> that uses tags to strcture and define elements within a document. FUN FACT: <strong>Every webpage contains HTML</strong>. A starting computer language, that is very basic and a great starting point for absoliute beginners who are starting out. You will quickly figure out whether or not Web Development is for you based on your experience with HTML. It reminds me of a strctured template and the wed developer plugs in the content and uses differents elements to communicate witht the computer. 
</p>
<p>
    Another "FUN FACT" <a href="https://www.craigslist.org" target="_blank">Craigslist</a> was made primarly with HTML. If you click on the provided link you can see just how basic an HTML webpage could look like. Would you all like to see super basic HTML on paper? I wrote somehting out for you look below. What you are lookig at is very basic but you can do a lot with it That is enough code to write a poem with a title. The DOCTYPE text is a code that tells the computer you are writing am HTML document so that we browsers can translate them to plain english. the brackets attatched to each word are called tags. The body stands refers to the body of the document, h1 stands for 1st header. That leaves us with the p tag, which identifies a paragraph within the body. When you put that code in. You get the results as shown below the. Becasue h1 is a header the text is automatically bigger than the rest of the documents.
</p>
 <p><!--ex tern link re css-->
     Second, on my list is <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/c/css.htm" target="_blank">CSS</a> this is a computer mark up language similar to HTML and they usually work hand to hand. Also called the sister language to HTML. HTML gives a webpage its content and CSS is responsible for the design of a website. Think of Craigslist, it is mostly HTML. Simple black and white, very little color aside from images posted by the user and the color of links. If we added color inside the headings and body of each categories, that would be CSS, also known as the sister language to HTML.It is also an easy language to learn if you have previously completed HTML.

    </figure>
 <br>
 <p><!--ex tern link re JavaScr-->
     That leaves us with <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/j/javascript.htm" target="_blank">JavaScript</a>. Javascript is a programming language and it is responsible for the actions and movements that are viewed on a webpage. Think of a basic object, I'll pick a ball. Picture the ball moving from the left of your screen, to the right then repeat itself. That is JavaScript. That is also the starting basics for some tennis games if you can picture that. Yes, you can also build basic games with JavaScript. J.S. is a fun and not super difficult language to learn. However, it is more challenging and complex than HTML or CSS. What do you think will hapen if we put all of the languages to create mini robots? Look down. After you gain experience writing code you start to see the world in code. Example: We see these two robots. the HTML is the plan box itself, the strcture of each robot. The CSS is the color added and it is how we identify what the box strctures are. Finally, Javascript is the reason our robots are walking and have lightup eyes.
</p>

    <p>
        If you can learn these three languages, consider this, a future congratulations!!! You will become a beginner web developer.

         Another Fun Fact: "It is better to master one programming language than learn many languages. Otherwise, you spread yourself too thin" <a href="https://github.com/eagarcia8" target="_blank">-Eduardo Garcia</a>. Feel free to visit his page and <em>follow him</em> :)

<!--CONCLUSION? STAY FOCUSED?-->
    <p>
        Stay Focused! There are a lot of resources out there, some may overlap, there are contradictions and eeveryone has a opinion. I've been there.

        <h2>Kahn Academy as a Free Resource</h2>
    </section>

<!--Talks about signing up for Kan Academy-->
    <p>
        Here is what you should do after leaving my web page, sign up for Kahn Academy. It is free website and it will get you started. I recommended K.A. as a starting point because the instructional videos are entertaining, well made, and beginner friendly. There is no limit on how much you can learn or how often you can utilize their resources, believe me it helped a lot. I especially like their open source community of students. Open source is a common term in the programming industry which means that anyone can assess your code and view it. The purpose is to learn, then as you grow. Before I move on, I wanted to mention that every instructional video comes with a printable transcript and chapter summaries. But hey do not take my word for it, sign up and see for yourself. If you dsecide you dont like developing or coding. Learn somehting else.

    <section id="camp">
         <h2>Free Code Camp as a Free Resource</h2>
    </section>

<!--Talking about free code camp as a resouce-->
    <p>
        What happens after you learn HTML, CSS, and J.S.? Take a week off and do it again! I recommend it, anyway.  Completing assignments are one thing but that alone will not make you a Web Developer, you have to consistently practice. So, sign up for free code camp and take advantage of their challenges, if you get stuck that is an indication that you need additional practice among those topics. They are another free source and anything free is good. I have practice with this site as well and it has its great points but it is a challenge to understand the written instructions when you are not completely familiar with the terminology. However, the challanges are quick and again, I recommend Free Code Camp after Kahn Academy because it is tougher to learn with their site,in my opinion but it will serve as a refresher. Speaking from experience, it has been very effective working on the same topics using a different platform. 
    </p>

    <section id="mobile">
        <h2>Free Mobile Apps</h2>
    </section>
    <p>
        Raise your hand if you knew you could code using mobile apps? I didn't know that starting out! Luckily, I found out. So, there are many mobile apps available via play store on your Android or Apple smart phone that will aid you in learning to code. Big question? Can you really learn to code using a smart phone? Yes, and no, everyone is different, keep that in mind. I would say you can potentially learn a new language. More or less become familiar with that language. In most cases you have to build projects to actually claim that you have learned that particular language. I recommend <a href="https://sololearn.com" target="_blank">SoloLearn</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.upskew.encode&hl=en_US" target="_blank">Encode</a>
    </p> 
    <p>
        SoloLearn is surprisingly well developed and well managed. Words cannot describe how amazed I was learning code in my space time. I encourage you to download SoloLearn first look around and see the many languages their app supports. Like, Kahn Academy, they too have an open source community and multiple ways to seek help in needed. Encode should be used to challange yourself, they offer many different exercises for you to complete in order to test yourself on your knowledge. It gives you a sense of understanding where you are at. It also keeps your mind busy and thinking about code when you do not have the time to dedicate to sitting in front of a computer.
    </p>
    <p>
        Any other computer or programing language is optional, it depends on the metaphorical path you want to travel on. Just dont travel the bridge to noware. It can also depend on what it is you are tryig to build. You can build web pages like me, or move on to mobile apps, and even video games. Which ever path you choose it should be based on your intreasts. Use Web Development as a starting point to see if you even like it. In other words, if you hate or cant comprehend HTML, CSS or JavaScript then maybe coding is not foo you. Each language you atempt to learn will take you on a different path. Speaking of pathways. Check out this link to <a href="https://blog.udemy.com/best-programming-language/" target="_blank">udemy.com</a> Pay attention to the images used on their site. They show a general path for Game Developers, Mobile App Developers, Web Developers and Software Developers. Their site has a lot of useful information and has been well researched.

        Do you have time for a joke? Why did the chicken cross the road? JavaScript made him do it. (well I thouht it was funny) Speaking of JavaScript,I just bought my first JavaScript and J-Quary book. FYI: this is not a free resource and I do not recommendanyonee buy any books at this point.

    <p>
         Disclaimer: I am not an expert. I am speaking from my own experience and I have written this page as a way for beginners to get started of their own Coding Journey. You have to do your own research to find out what works best for you. Do not take my word for it and do not buy something just because I recommended it. Do your research first!

        We talked about three basic languages to get started with. Free mobile apps that are avaliable for downloads and websites to visit and all are free. I even added a list below for your convience.
