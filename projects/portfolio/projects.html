    <h2> What can I do for You?</h2>
        <p class="tab">Here you can find projects that I have worked on that have led me up to this multiple web page you are viewing now. My most basic project is titled, Hobbies: my hobbies project is where I talk about coding as a hobby of mine, before becoming an official Web Developer. For fun I thought you all might like to see how far I've come. My <link><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/jpinka/" target="_blank">KAHN ACADEMY</a> projects are also up for viewing. There you will find a series of projects ranging from HTML to JavaScript. On a More formal Note, I have also attached my RESUME for all you traditional birds out there.</p>

    <h2>Simple Gallery Sample</h2>
        <p class="tab">Below, please check our gallery. This gallery is just a few popular tourist spots found in San Francisco. I can build something similar on your site as well. Here, you get to see just a small bit of what I can do. I can build some as simple as craigslist  or I can build you something more complex and colorful. My goal is to make your website vision a reality. If your vision is unclear, I can help you with that too. I am very patient and I will work with you until you are satisfied with the final product. </p>
