    <h2> Greetings Everyone!</h2>
        <p class="tab">My name is Jesica, a San Francisco native and I specialize in creating web pages for small businesses and I'm confident that I can build yours. I can build an informational web page or a full, multipage website, your choice. <br /> 
        <br><span> Best part is that all of my web sites come fully responsive at no extra charge. Are you intrigued? Keep reading.</span></p>

    <h2>A Little bit about my Background</h2>
        <p class="tab">I've been Web Developing for about a year now and I have experience in the following languages: HTML, CSS and Java Script. I have also mild experience with Python. I do come from an artistic background so Web Developing to me, is similar to art. It allows me to be as creative or structured as my imagination allows. My canvas is my computer screen but now the world is my audience.</p>
