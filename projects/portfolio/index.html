    <h2> Greetings Everyone!</h2>
        <p class="tab">My name is Jesica, a San Francisco native and I specialize in creating web pages for small businesses and I'm confident that I can build yours. I can build an informational web page [external link]or a full, multipage website[external link], your choice. <br />
        <br><span> Best part is that all of my web sites come fully responsive at no extra charge. Are you intrigued? Keep reading.</span>

    <h2>What can I do for you?</h2>
      <p class="tab">Below, please check our gallery. I can build something similar on your site as well. Here, you get to see just a small bit of what I can do. I can build some as simple as craigslist  or I can build you something more complex and colorful. My goal is to make your website vision a reality. If your vision is unclear, I can help you with that too. I am very patient and I will work with you until you are satisfied with the final product.<br />  
        
        <br>My experience is in the following computer/programming languages:<br>
        <br>~HTML
        <br>~CSS
        <br>~JavaScript<br />
